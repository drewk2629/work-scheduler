# Work Day Scheduler

When I open the planner the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.

Using the standard work hour time block when viewing each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. You can click into a time block and enter an event.

When you click the save button for that time block the text for that event is saved in local storage and you can refresh the page to see the info stays.
